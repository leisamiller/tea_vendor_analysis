# tea_vendor_analysis
See how teaware from different online vendors compare to each other. Who sells the least expensive and biggest teapots on the web?

Open the jupyter notebook file and run all the cells. In version 1.0, the code will scrape the name, material, price, and volume of the teapots and gaiwans from the teaware vendor Teaware.House, clean the data, and then present the min, max, median, and mean price of the categories. It will also present a visualization comparing the materials used to make each gaiwan and teapot.
