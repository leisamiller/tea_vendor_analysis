# tea_vendor_analysis
Who sells the least expensive and biggest teapots on the web? This project will show you how teaware from different online vendors compare to each other. 

V1.0 - 01/08/2019
Open the jupyter notebook (Teaware_House_df_v1.0.ipynb) file and run all the cells.

In version 1.0, the code will scrape the name, material, price, and volume of the teapots and gaiwans from the teaware vendor Teaware.House, clean the data, and then present the min, max, median, and mean price of the categories. It will also present a visualization comparing the materials used to make each gaiwan and teapot.

FUTURE PLANS
- Improve and add more visualizations/analysis
- Scrape teapot and gaiwan data from other vendors (Bitterleaf.com, Eco-Cha.com, Crimsonlotustea.com)
- Add data for "easy gaiwans" and tea cups
- Make visualizations self-serve and/or interactive
